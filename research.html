					<h3>Asteroseismology: a brief overview</h3>

					<div class="image">
					  <span class="image right"><img src="images/SYMPHONY_logo.png" alt="SYMPHONY"></span>

					  	<p>Asteroseismology is the study of oscillations inside stars, which telescopes
							 capture as changes in their surface brightness. The detection of
							 stellar oscillation frequencies allows us to probe
							 the physics of stellar structure and evolution, with the ultimate
							 goal of asteroseismology being to improve our understanding of the
							 interior physical conditions and processes for a diverse range of stars. The
							 quality of space observations, such as from the CoRoT,
							 <i>Kepler</i>/K2 and TESS space telescopes, provide an excellent
							 opportunity to study physics that is not currently well
							 understood for massive stars.
						</p>

						<p>My current UKRI Frontier Research Grant, <a href="https://research.ncl.ac.uk/symphony/"><b><font color="#2E86C1">SYMPHONY</font></b></a> (2023-2028; [EP/Y031059/1]),
							 focuses on asteroseismology of massive stars, which are those that will eventually
							 explode as violent supernovae and leave behind a neutron star or black hole.
							 The project is using existing and developing new techniques for applying
							 asteroseismology and determining the physical properties of massive
							 stars, with a particular focus on Blue Supergiants, such as their interior rotation profiles, masses and ages.
							 These properties are not accurately known for massive
							 stars because our best current theoretical models contain large uncertainties. Massive stars
							 pulsate in gravity and pressure mode oscillations which
							 probe the deep stellar interiors and radiative envelopes, respectively,
							 thus provide excellent insight of the physics at work within stellar
							 interiors. The ongoing TESS mission is targeting thousands of
							 massive stars thanks to my several <a href="https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/tess/approved-programs.html">TESS GI proposals as PI</a>
							 spanning cycles 1-6. In addition to these new TESS data, the <a href="https://research.ncl.ac.uk/symphony/"><b><font color="#2E86C1">SYMPHONY</font></b></a>
							 project is exploiting high-resolution spectroscopy from ESO, Mercator, and SONG, and the upcoming KU Leuven
							 <a href="https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster/instruments/cubespec">CubeSpec</font></a> mission.

				 <h3>SLF variability: Internal gravity waves</h3>
				 	<p>I am also interested in the search for and interpretation of the
						 signatures of stochastic internal gravity waves in massive stars. As part of
						 this work, I led the project to discover that essentially all massive stars have
						 Stochastic Low Frequency (SLF) variability in time series photometry,
						 which is consistent with predictions from numerical simulations of
						 stochastic gravity waves excited by core convection. In the past, I performed this
						 research under the framework of Prof. Conny Aerts' ERC advanced
						 grant: <a href="https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster/Projects/mamsie">MAMSIE</a>
						 (Mixing and Angular Momentum tranSport of massIvE stars; 2016-2020),
						 but have since developed its methodology and results considerably.
						 The ultimate goals are to combine observations with 3D
						 hydrodynamical simulations and improve our understanding of mixing and
						 angular momentum transport caused by stochastic internal gravity waves
						 within stellar structure and evolution theory for massive stars.</p>

					 <h3>The ESA/KU Leuven CubeSpec space mission</h3>
					 <span class="image right"><img src="images/CubeSpec_figure.png" alt="CubeSpec"></span>
						<p>The instrument team of the Institute of Astronomy at KU Leuven are
							currently building the ESA/KU Leuven CubeSpec space mission, which
							is a cubesat platform dedicated to massive star asteroseismology
							with a scheduled launch in early 2026. CubeSpec is a fully funded
							ESA in-orbit proof-of-concept mission to assemble high-resolution
							time-series optical spectroscopy of pulsating massive stars and passed
							ESA preliminary design review in 2021. These CubeSpec data will be
							invaluable in enabling asteroseismology of
							pulsating massive stars, which typically exhibit line profile
							variability that can be used to identify the geometry of their pulsation modes in
							terms of spherical harmonics. High-resolution, time-series optical
						  	spectroscopy of massive stars will also be invaluable for studying
						  	their atmospheric (e.g. winds and mass loss) and extrinsic (e.g. binarity)
						  	sources of variability. The CubeSpec mission data will be unique as
							high-cadence, high-resolution, optical spectroscopy spanning several months
							from a space telescope is currently not available for massive stars.</p>
