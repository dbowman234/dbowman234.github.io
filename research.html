					<h3>Asteroseismology: a brief overview</h3>

					<div class="image">
					  <span class="image right"><img src="images/TESSERACT_blue_logo.png" alt="TESSERACT"></span>

					  <p>I am an <a href="https://www.fwo.be/en/">FWO</a>
							 senior postdoctoral research fellow based at the
							 <a href="https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster">Institute of Astronomy</a>
							 at the KU Leuven in Belgium. My research interests include
							 asteroseismology of high- and intermediate-mass stars, including
							 beta Cephei, SPB, delta Scuti, roAp and gamma Doradus stars.
							 Asteroseismology uses stellar oscillation frequencies to probe
							 stellar structure and evolution, with the ultimate goal being to
							 improve theoretical models for a diverse range of stars. The
							 quality of space observations, such as from the CoRoT,
							 <i>Kepler</i>/K2 and TESS space telescopes, provide an excellent
							 opportunity to study physics that is not currently well
							 understood for massive stars.
						 </p>

						 <p>My current FWO research grant, <font color="blue">TESSERACT</font>,
							 is to improve existing and develop new techniques for using
							 asteroseismology to determine the physical properties of massive
							 stars, such as (core) masses and ages. These properties are not accurately known for massive
							 stars, because models contain large uncertainties. Massive stars
							 pulsate in gravity (g) and pressure (p) mode oscillations which
							 probe the deep stellar interiors and radiative envelopes, respectively,
							 thus provide excellent insight of the physics at work within stellar
							 interiors. The ongoing TESS mission is targeting thousands of
							 massive stars, which the <font color="blue">TESSERACT</font>
							 project is exploiting using asteroseismology combined with
							 high-resolution spectroscopy from ESO and Mercator.

				 <h3>Internal gravity waves</h3>
				 	<p>I am also interested in the search for and interpretation of the
						 signatures of internal gravity waves in massive stars. As part of
						 this work, we discovered that essentially all massive stars have
						 Stochastic Low Frequency (SLF) variabilty in time series photometry,
						 which is consistent with predictions from numerical simulations of
						 gravity waves excited by core convvection. In the past, I performed this
						 research under the framework of Prof. Conny Aerts' ERC advanced
						 grant: <a href="https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster/Projects/mamsie">MAMSIE</a>
						 (Mixing and Angular Momentum tranSport of massIvE stars). The
						 MAMSIE team consisted of academics, post-docs and PhD students from
						 within the KU Leuven, and had strong links to the research team
						 led by Professor Tamara Rogers at Newcastle University in the UK.
						 The goal of MAMSIE was to combine observations with 3D
						 hydrodynamical simulations and improve our understanding of stellar
						 structure and evolution for massive stars. More specifically, constraints
						 from seismic observables of gravity waves allowed prescriptions for angular
						 momentum transport caused by internal gravity waves and mixing by
						 turbulent entrainment to be formulated.</p>

					 <h3>The ESA/KU Leuven CubeSpec space mission</h3>
					 <span class="image right"><img src="images/CubeSpec_figure.png" alt="CubeSpec"></span>
						<p>The instrument team of the Institute of Astronomy at KU Leuven are
							currently building the ESA/KU Leuven CubeSpec space mission, which
							is a cubesat platform dedicated to massive star asteroseismology
							with an scheduled launch in early 2024. CubeSpec is a fully funded
							ESA in-orbit proof-of-concept mission to assemble high-resolution
							time-series optical spectroscopy of pulsating massive stars and passed
							ESA preliminary design review in 2021. These CubeSpec data will be
							invaluable in enabling asteroseismology of
							pulsating massive stars, which typically exhibit line profile
							variabilty that can be used to identify their pulsation modes in
							terms of spherical geometry. High-resolution, time-series optical
						  spectroscopy of massive stars will also be invaluable for studying
						  their atmospheric (e.g. winds and mass loss) and extrinsic (e.g. binarity)
						  sources of variabilty. The CubeSpec mission data will be unique as
							high-cadence, high-resolution, optical spectroscopy spanning several months
							from a space telescope is currently not available for massive stars.</p>

							 and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.11848">initial design concept</font></a>.

					<h3>Computing languages</h3>
					<p>I have extensive experience using Python, Fortran and IDL for
						 scientific projects. Furthermore, I have developed my skills with
						 the stellar evolution code <a href="http://mesa.sourceforge.net">MESA</a> and the stellar pulsation code <a href="https://gyre.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">GYRE</a>
						 for the purpose of forward seismic modelling of high- and
						 intermediate-mass stars. I am also proficient with LaTeX and html
						 in the context of both scientific and non-scientific projects.</p>

					<h3>Scientific talks, conference participation and observing experience</h3>
					<p>As an astronomer and an academic, I am very fortunate to travel the
						 world as part of my job. My Curriculum Vitae contains a complete
						 list of all my past and ongoing observing projects, and experience
						 I have at telescopes around the world which exceeds 100 nights at
						 professional observatories. Also, it contains a summary
						 of the conferences that I have attended, the invited and
						 contributed talks I have presented at conferences, and department
						 colloquia I have delivered.</p>
