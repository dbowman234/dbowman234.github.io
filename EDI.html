						<h2>Equality, Diversity and Inclusion</h2>
					</header>

					<p>It is very important to me personally and professionally to be committed to
					making a significant contribution to Equality, Diversity & Inclusion (EDI), both
					within academia but also the wider world. Below are some concrete examples of activities
					I have helped organise and participate in during my career, which I am always
					trying to improve and expand upon.</p>


					  <h3>Disadvantaged Social Groups</h3>
						<p>In the 2022-2023 academic year, I was a teaching fellow for the
							  <a href="https://worldsciencescholars.com/homepage/">World Science Scholars</a>
								program of the World Science Festival, which aimed to inspire and provided
								university-level research exposure and mentoring sessions for gifted
								and talented high-school students
								from all backgrounds around the world to realise their full potential in STEM.</p>

						<h3>Women in Science</h3>
						<p>Whilst at KU Leuven as a postdoctoral researcher, I helped organise
						annual workshops in astronomy as part of the <a href="https://wet.kuleuven.be/ladiesatscience">Ladies@Science</a>
						event for female high-school students. A fantastic resource for finding excellent female public speakers
					  for STEM outreach is available: <a href="https://gage.500womenscientists.org">here</a>.</p>

						<h3>LGBTQIA+</h3>
						<p>Newcastle University is a Stonewall Diversity Champanion and has a
						fantastic support network through its <a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/who-we-are/equality/lgbt/">Rainbow Network</a>.
						Other support networks include the <a href="https://www.iop.org/about/iop-diversity-inclusion/LGBT-physical-sciences-network">Institute of Physics</a>
						and the <a href="https://astro-outlist.github.io">Astronomy and Astrophysics Outlist</a>.</p>

						<h3>Early Career Researchers (ECRs)</h3>
						<pstyle=”margin-bottom: 4px;”>In Summer 2020, a group of ECR Fellows within the Royal Astronomical
							 Society (RAS) set up the <a href="https://ras.ac.uk/about-ras/committees-membership-fellows/early-career-network-committee">Early Career Network (ECN)</a>.
							 Between its inception and until March 2023, I was the Secretary of
							 committee of the ECN.

							 <pstyle=”margin-bottom: 4px;”>The main goals of the ECN are to:
							 <li>Build a support network of ECR peers in astronomy, geophysics and beyond</li>
							 <li>Support ECRs to join and maximally engage with the RAS</li>
							 <li>Provide tangible access to experts and career mentoring across different career options</li>
							 <li>Facilitate skills training and support of ECRs</li></p>

						<pstyle=”margin-bottom: 4px;”>As an official part of the RAS, the ECN committee had responsibility for:
							 <li>Oversight of ECN activities and that they follow the RAS Diversity, Equality and Inclusion Policy</li>
							 <li>Ensuring that ECN events supported by the RAS operate within their defined budget</li>
							 <li>Bridging ECRs, RAS staff and RAS council</li>
							 <li>Evaluating the effectiveness of ECN activities and monitor impact</li>
							 <li>Liaising with the RAS membership committee</li></p>

						<pstyle=”margin-bottom: 4px;”>The events I helped organise during my time as Secretary included a poster competition,
							 careers training and mentoring workshops, and a well-being survey. The outcomes
							 of these events were synthesised in a series of open-access A&G articles:
							 <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/astrogeo/atab076">'Hear it through the grapevine</a>: advice from panel members on how to find your first postdoc</li>
							 <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/astrogeo/atac039">'Stay in love with your PhD'</a>: mentoring advice from the ECN's first event</li>
							 <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/astrogeo/atac037">'Generation Covid'</a>: mental health and impact survey of the COVID pandemic on ECRs</li>
							 <li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/astrogeo/atab039">'Pandemic posters'</a>: highlights from the ECN's ECR poster competition</li></p>
