					<p>I was born in the United Kingdom and hold both British and Irish citizenship.
						 I went to high school in Preston between 2002 and 2007, graduating with the James Henderson
						 trophy for academic achievement. I also attended college in Preston between 2007
						 and 2009 and studied Physics, Maths, Chemistry and Biology at GCE A-level. Between
						 2009 and 2013, I was an undergraduate at the University of Birmingham and attained
						 a first-class with honours Master of Science (MSci) in Physics and Astrophysics in July
						 2013. I completed my PhD in astronomy at the University of Central Lancashire in
						 November 2016, which was funded by the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council
						 (STFC). Since 2017, I live and work in Leuven, Belgium as a postdoctoral research
						 fellow at KU Leuven. </p>

					<h3>Research Network</h3>
					<p>I currently hold leading roles in several international consortia, including
						 <a href="https://mobster-collab.com">MOBSTER</a>,
						 <a href="https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster/instruments/cubespec">CubeSpec </a>,
						 <a href="https://massivestars.org/xshootu/">XShootU</a>,
						 <a href="https://brite-constellation.at/constellation/management/">BEST</a>, and
						 <a href="http://arago-mission.obspm.fr">Arago</a>,
					   which are focussed on the study of massive stars using a variety of astronomical techniques.
						 I am a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society (FRAS), a Member of the Institute
						 of Physics (MInstP), a member of the European Astronomical Society (EAS) and a
						 junior member of the <a href="https://iau.org/administration/membership/individual/19211/">International Astronomical Union (IAU)</a>.
						 These professional organisations allow me to network with other researchers in physics and
						 astronomy. They also organise scientific meetings, training and mentoring workshops,
						 which I have attended to improve my communication, outreach and career prospects,
						 and pass my knowledge and experience onto others.</p>

						 <p>Between 2020 and 2023,
						 I was the Secretary of the UK Royal Astronomical Society (RAS)
						 <a href="https://ras.ac.uk/about-ras/committees-membership-fellows/early-career-network-committee">Early Career Network (ECN)</a>.
						 We organised several peer mentoring, training and advocacy workshops,
						 which have led to several publications in the RAS's Astronomy & Geophysics (A&G)
						 journal. As an example, I am the leading author on the A&G articles summarising the ECN's
						 <a href="https://academic.oup.com/astrogeo/article/62/4/4.12/6318267">'How to find your first postdoc'</a>
						 and <a href="https://academic.oup.com/astrogeo/article/63/3/3.32/6586419">'PhD mentoring'</a> events.</p>

					<h3>Important Achievements</h3>
					<p>In October 2017, my PhD thesis was published as a <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319666488#otherversion=9783319666495">Springer monograph</a>.
						 In May 2019, I published a first-author paper in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-019-0768-1">Nature Astronomy</a>
						 on part of my postdoctoral research on gravity waves at KU Leuven, which was selected as the cover image
						 for the <a href="https://www.nature.com/natastron/volumes/3/issues/8">August 2019</a>
						 issue. In May 2020, I was awarded the prestigious <a href="https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster/news/2020/dr-dominic-bowman-wins-highly-prestigious-ku-leuven-research-council-award-2020">KU Leuven Research Council Award</a>
						 in Science, Engineering and Technology (2020) for my breakthrough research in
						 asteroseismology of massive stars, which is an annual prize awarded to
						 only a single postdoctoral researcher. In December 2022, I won the <a href="https://kvab.be/en/node/163/23">Henri Vanderlinden Prize</a>
						 from the Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for Science and the Arts
						 for an outstanding piece of original research work in astronomy. In January 2023,
					 	 I was awarded the <a href="https://ras.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2023-01/George%20Darwin%20Lectures%20-%20Dr.%20Dominic%20Bowman.pdf">2023 George Darwin Lectureship</a> of the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS),
						 for being an authoritative and engaging researcher and communicator of astronomy.</p>

					<p> <b>In recent news:</b> I have been awarded a prestigous ERC Starting Grant for my SYMPHONY project,
 							which will combine TESS photometry and spectroscopy,
 							including from the ESA/KU Leuven CubeSpec space mission, to perform asteroseismology of massive stars and
 							constrain their uncertain interior physical processes. More information can be found
 							<a href="https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster/news/2023/dominic-bowman-awarded-prestigious-erc-starting-grant-for-massive-star-asteroseismology">here</a>.</p>

					<h3>Hobbies</h3>
					<p>In my spare time, I enjoy reading (especially classic science fiction) and also
						 enjoy hiking, swimming, climbing, and playing badminton and squash with friends
						 and colleagues. Of course, since I work at the KU Leuven I also enjoy cycling,
						 which is a must for someone living in Belgium!</p>
