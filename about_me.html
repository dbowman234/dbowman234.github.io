					<p>I was born in the United Kingdom and hold both British and Irish citizenship.
						 I went to high school in Preston between 2002 and 2007, graduating with the James Henderson
						 trophy for academic achievement. I also attended college in Preston between 2007
						 and 2009 and studied Physics, Maths, Chemistry and Biology at GCE A-level. Between
						 2009 and 2013, I was an undergraduate at the University of Birmingham and attained
						 a first-class with honours Master of Science (MSci) in Physics and Astrophysics in July
						 2013. I completed my PhD in astronomy at the University of Central Lancashire in
						 November 2016, which was funded by the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council
						 (STFC). Between February 2017 and October 2020, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the group of
						 Prof. Conny Aerts at the <a href="https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster">Institute of Astronomy</a>,
						 KU Leuven, Belgium, and between Novemeber 2020 and August 2023 I was an
						 <a href="https://www.fwo.be/en/">FWO</a> senior postdoctoral research fellow also based at KU Leuven.
						 Since September 2023, I hold a Readership Faculty position
					   in the <a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/maths-physics/">School of Mathematics, Statistics and Physics</a>
						 at Newcastle University in the UK. In my spare time, I enjoy reading (especially classic science fiction) and also
						 enjoy hiking, swimming, climbing, and playing badminton and squash with friends
					   and colleagues.</p>




					<h3>Research Network</h3>
					<p>I am a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society (FRAS), a Member of the Institute
						 of Physics (MInstP), a member of the European Astronomical Society (EAS) and a
						 junior member of the <a href="https://iau.org/administration/membership/individual/19211/">International Astronomical Union (IAU)</a>.
						 These professional organisations allow me to network with other researchers in physics and
						 astronomy. They also organise scientific meetings, training and mentoring workshops,
						 which I have attended to improve my communication, outreach and career prospects,
						 and pass my knowledge and experience onto others. I currently hold leading roles in several international consortia, including:
	 						<li><a href="https://mobster-collab.com">MOBSTER</a>: Detection,
								characterisation and understanding of magnetic fields in early-type stars</li>
	 						<li><a href="https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster/instruments/cubespec">CubeSpec</a>:
								in-orbit proof-of-concept for spectroscopy with a cubesat and facilitating
								massive star asteroseismology from spectroscopic line profile variability</li>
	 						<li><a href="https://massivestars.org/xshootu/">XShootU</a>: UV, visible and infrared
								spectroscopy of massive stars at low metallicity</li>
	 						<li><a href="https://brite-constellation.at/constellation/management/">BEST</a>:
								coordination of the BRITE-Constellation network of cubesats assembling time-series
								photometry of bright stars</li>
	 						<li><a href="http://arago-mission.obspm.fr">Arago</a>: candidate mission for M7 ESA call; chair of the 'Hot BA star'
							working group</li></p>

					<h3>Important Achievements</h3>
					<p>In October 2017, my PhD thesis was published as a <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319666488#otherversion=9783319666495">Springer monograph</a>.
						 In May 2019, I published a first-author paper in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-019-0768-1">Nature Astronomy</a>
						 on my postdoctoral research on gravity waves at KU Leuven, which was selected as the cover image
						 for the <a href="https://www.nature.com/natastron/volumes/3/issues/8">August 2019</a>
						 issue. In May 2020, I was awarded the prestigious <a href="https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster/news/2020/dr-dominic-bowman-wins-highly-prestigious-ku-leuven-research-council-award-2020">KU Leuven Research Council Award</a>
						 in Science, Engineering and Technology (2020) for my breakthrough research in
						 asteroseismology of massive stars, which is an annual prize awarded to
						 only a single postdoctoral researcher. In December 2022, I won the <a href="https://kvab.be/en/node/163/23">Henri Vanderlinden Prize</a>
						 from the Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for Science and the Arts
						 for an outstanding piece of original research work in astronomy. In January 2023,
					 	 I was awarded the <a href="https://ras.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2023-01/George%20Darwin%20Lectures%20-%20Dr.%20Dominic%20Bowman.pdf">2023 George Darwin Lectureship</a> of the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS),
						 for being an authoritative and engaging researcher and communicator of astronomy.</p>

					<p><b>In recent news:</b> I have been awarded a prestigous ERC Starting Grant for my <a href="https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster/news/2023/dominic-bowman-awarded-prestigious-erc-starting-grant-for-massive-star-asteroseismology">SYMPHONY</a>
						  project, which will combine TESS photometry and spectroscopy,
 							including from the ESA/KU Leuven CubeSpec space mission, to perform asteroseismology of massive stars and
 							constrain their uncertain interior physical processes.
 						  As of 1 September 2023, I began a Readership Faculty position at
							Newcastle University, UK, to implement my SYMPHONY project as a UKRI Frontier
							Research Grant [EP/Y031059/1], but I maintain a strong research connection to KU Leuven, Belgium.</p>
