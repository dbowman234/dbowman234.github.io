					<div class="image round">
					  <span class="image right"><img src="images/me_alston.jpg" alt="" /></span>

					<p>I was born in the United Kingdom and hold both British and Irish citizenship.
						 I went to high school in Preston between 2002 and 2007, graduating with the James Henderson
						 trophy for academic achievement. I also attended college in Preston between 2007
						 and 2009 and studied Physics, Maths, Chemistry and Biology at GCE A-level. Between
						 2009 and 2013, I was an undergraduate at the University of Birmingham and attained
						 a first-class with honours Master of Science (MSci) in Physics and Astrophysics in July
						 2013. I completed my PhD in astronomy at the <a href="https://www.star.uclan.ac.uk">University of Central Lancashire</a> in
						 November 2016, which was funded by the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council
						 (STFC). Between February 2017 and October 2020, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the group of
						 Prof. Conny Aerts at the <a href="https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster">Institute of Astronomy</a>,
						 KU Leuven, Belgium, and between November 2020 and August 2023 I was an
						 <a href="https://www.fwo.be/en/">FWO</a> senior postdoctoral research fellow also based at KU Leuven. 
						 Since September 2023, I hold a Readership Faculty position in the <a href="https://www.ncl.ac.uk/maths-physics/">School of Mathematics, Statistics and Physics</a>
						 at Newcastle University in the UK. As of December 2023 I also hold a Royal Society University 
						 Research Fellowship (URF) in addition to my faculty position and my ongoing <a href="https://research.ncl.ac.uk/symphony/">ERC/UKRI SYMPHONY</a> grant. 
						 In my spare time, I enjoy reading (especially classic science fiction) and also
						 enjoy hiking, swimming, climbing, and playing badminton and squash with friends and colleagues.

					<h3>Research Network</h3>
					<p>I am a fellow of the <a href="https://ras.ac.uk">Royal Astronomical Society</a> (FRAS), a Member of the <a href="https://www.iop.org">Institute
						 of Physics</a> (MInstP), a member of the <a href="https://eas.unige.ch">European Astronomical Society</a> (EAS) and a
						 junior member of the <a href="https://iau.org/administration/membership/individual/19211/">International Astronomical Union (IAU)</a>.
						 These professional organisations allow me to network with other researchers in physics and
						 astronomy. They also organise scientific meetings, training and mentoring workshops,
						 which I have attended to improve my communication, outreach and career prospects,
						 and pass my knowledge and experience onto others. I currently hold leading roles in several international consortia, including:
	 						<li><a href="https://mobster-collab.com">MOBSTER</a>: Detection,
								characterisation and understanding of magnetic fields in early-type stars</li>
	 						<li><a href="https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster/instruments/cubespec">CubeSpec</a>:
								in-orbit proof-of-concept for spectroscopy with a cubesat and facilitating
								massive star asteroseismology from spectroscopic line profile variability</li>
	 						<li><a href="https://massivestars.org/xshootu/">XShootU</a>: UV, visible and infrared
								spectroscopy of massive stars at low metallicity</li>
	 						<li><a href="https://brite-constellation.at/constellation/management/">BEST</a>:
								coordination of the BRITE-Constellation network of cubesats assembling time-series
								photometry of bright stars</li>
	 						<li><a href="http://arago-mission.obspm.fr">Arago</a>: candidate mission for M7 ESA call; chair of the 'Hot BA star'
							working group</li></p>

					<h3>Important Achievements</h3>
					<p>In October 2017, my PhD thesis was published as a <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9783319666488#otherversion=9783319666495">Springer monograph</a>.
						 In May 2019, I published a first-author paper in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-019-0768-1">Nature Astronomy</a>
						 on my postdoctoral research on gravity waves at KU Leuven, which was selected as the cover image
						 for the <a href="https://www.nature.com/natastron/volumes/3/issues/8">August 2019</a>
						 issue. In May 2020, I was awarded the prestigious <a href="https://fys.kuleuven.be/ster/news/2020/dr-dominic-bowman-wins-highly-prestigious-ku-leuven-research-council-award-2020">KU Leuven Research Council Award</a>
						 in Science, Engineering and Technology (2020) for my breakthrough research in
						 asteroseismology of massive stars, which is an annual prize awarded to
						 only a single postdoctoral researcher. In December 2022, I won the <a href="https://kvab.be/en/node/163/23">Henri Vanderlinden Prize</a>
						 from the Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for Science and the Arts
						 for an outstanding piece of original research work in astronomy. In January 2023,
					 	 I was awarded the <a href="https://ras.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2023-01/George%20Darwin%20Lectures%20-%20Dr.%20Dominic%20Bowman.pdf">2023 George Darwin Lectureship</a> of the Royal Astronomical Society (RAS),
						 for being an authoritative and engaging researcher and communicator of astronomy.
